# Natours-API

The Natours API is the backend for a tour booking platform, providing comprehensive and secure  
endpoints to manage tours, user interactions, bookings, and reviews. Built with Node.js,  
Express, and MongoDB, this API supports scalable, high-performance operations designed to  
power dynamic web applications.

## Project Overview

The Natours API provides functionality for managing and exploring tours and bookings,  
as well as user and review management. Designed with performance and scalability in mind,  
the API is capable of handling high traffic and complex queries with ease.  
This API is suitable for powering the backend of a tour booking web application.

## Features

This API offers a variety of robust features to support a full-featured tour booking platform.

### User Management

-   User Registration & Authentication: Secure registration and login, including email verification  
    and password reset functionality.
-   Role-Based Authorization: Controls access based on user roles (e.g., admin, guide, customer) to ensure  
    that only authorized users can access or modify certain resources.

### Tour Management

-   CRUD Operations for Tours: Create, update, retrieve, and delete tours, with detailed  
    control over tour attributes.
-   Tour Pricing & Discounts: Configure dynamic pricing, seasonal discounts, and
    special offers for tours.
-   Geo-Location & Mapping: Includes geolocation data for each tour to integrate with  
    map services and support location-based searches.

### Booking System

### Data Validation & Sanitization

-   Input Validation: Enforces data consistency and integrity, with rules based on Mongoose schemas and custom validation
    functions.

### Technologies Used

-   **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
-   **Express**: Lightweight web framework for handling routing and middleware.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data in a flexible document structure.
-   **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB, providing schema validation and querying features.
-   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure authentication and session management.
-   **bcrypt**: For secure password hashing.

### Architecture
